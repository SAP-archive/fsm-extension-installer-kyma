# How to set up extension installer
## Prerequisites
In order to install extension installer in Kyma, you must fulfill the following requirements:

1. You must have [k8s CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) installed.
2. You must have [Helm 2 CLI](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm) installed.
3. You must have set up Kyma connection with FSM and created an **Application** in Kyma by following the [guide](https://docs.coresystems.net/extensions-ui-plugins/cloud-platform-extension-factory-integration.html).

## Installation Process
1. Open the Kyma console and create a **Namespace** where you want to deploy the extension installer.
2. Create bindings for **Application** that you have created in Kyma.

    a. Navigate to the application and click **+ Create Bindings**.

    b. Select the namespace that you created in step 1 and disable **Select all** of Services & Events.

    c. Select **Extension Catalog API**. Then save it.
3. Create service instance for **Application** that you have created in Kyma.
    
    a. Navigate to the namespace that you created in step 1.

    b. Select **Catalog** in left navigation sidebar. Then switch to **Services** and navigate to the service that corresponds to the **Application** that you have created in Kyma.

    c. Click **Add once** to provision a service instance. Enter a service instance name and save it. And you can see your instance in Kyma console under **Instance**.
4. Download the config for Kyma cluster from General Settings page of Kyma console. 

    *Note*: **Your kube config expires every 8 hours!**

 5. Access Kyma connector using Kubectl with command:
 
    `kubectl --kubeconfig /custom/path/kubeconfig.yml`
     
    If you prefer to have only one config file for all your k8s context, you could refer this [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).

6. Configure helm in order to manage resource in Kyma. See the [reference](https://kyma-project.io/docs/#installation-use-helm).

7. Deploy extension installer.

    Change the current directory into downloaded extension installer directory. Execute the command:
    `helm install ./helm/fsm-extension-installer/ --name=<extension_installer_name> --set appName=<application_name> --set serviceInstanceName=<service_instance_name> --set kyma.verison=<kyma_version> --namespace=<kyma_namespace> --tls`
    
    And replace the variables as follows:

    `<extension_installer_name>`: your extension installer name

    `<application_name>`: the one you created in step 3 of Prerequisites section

    `<service_instance_name>`: the service instance name you entered in step 3.c

    `<kyma_version>`: the version of Kyma

    `<kyma_namespace>`: the one you created step 1
